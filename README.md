User Interface for Elderly Users with Memory Impairments

This project involves the development of a user interface for smartphones tailored to assist elderly users experiencing memory impairments or dementia. The interface simplifies common functions, ensuring usability, safety, and support in daily activities, ultimately enhancing their autonomy and quality of life. The project was developed following the spiral development model across three cycles, with constant evaluation and user feedback.

Features:

  Panic Button:
  
    Provides immediate assistance during emergencies.
    
    Sends messages to pre-selected contacts with the userâ€™s location and initiates automatic calls in order of priority.
    
    Escalates to public services if no contacts respond.
    
    Accessible via a large, clear button with straightforward instructions.
  
  Calls:
  
    Enables easy access to key contacts through Speed Dial buttons.
    
    Includes a simple interface for adding, editing, and deleting contacts.
    
    Supports both voice calls and video calls.
    
    Displays contacts in a family-tree-like structure for easier identification.
  
  Navigation (Maps):
  
    Offers clear, guided navigation to frequent destinations, such as home or a pharmacy.
    
    Users or caretakers can add and manage destinations with ease.
    
    Utilizes GPS to provide accurate directions.
  
  Reminders:
  
    Allows users or caretakers to set reminders for medications, appointments, and other events.
    
    Includes options for recurring or single reminders.
    
    Features a clean calendar view and intuitive reminder management.
  
  Photo Collection:
  
    Displays photos in two viewing modes: chronological order or based on the number of views.
    
    Simplifies access to cherished memories for emotional and cognitive support.
    
    Offers voice command functionality for easier navigation.
  
  Voice Command Integration:
  
    Enables users to navigate the interface and select functions using voice commands.
    
    Enhances accessibility and convenience, especially for users with limited dexterity.

Development Phases:

  First Cycle:
  
    Defined the target user group (elderly with memory impairments) and their specific needs.
    
    Created simple prototypes to test basic interface concepts.
    
    Evaluated through questionnaires and interviews, identifying key user requirements.
    
  Second Cycle:
  
    Developed a more detailed prototype, incorporating functions like panic button, calls, and reminders.
    
    Conducted usability evaluations, including heuristic inspections and user feedback through surveys and cognitive walkthroughs.
    
    Refined the interface based on findings, focusing on simplifying complex tasks.
  
  Third Cycle:
  
    Implemented the final prototype using Android Studio, ensuring compatibility with real devices.
    
    Integrated voice command support and polished features like navigation and photo sorting.
    
    Evaluated the interface using questionnaires, think-aloud protocols, cognitive walkthroughs, and interviews.

  
Evaluation Insights:
  
    Users appreciated the large, clear fonts and intuitive layout.
    
    Voice commands significantly improved usability and efficiency.
    
    Recommendations included providing full-screen navigation maps and enhancing reminder setup clarity.
    
    The interface received high scores for accessibility, usefulness, and overall user satisfaction.

  
Technical Details:
  
    Platform: Android Studio (final prototype compatible with real devices or emulators).
    
    Languages and Tools: Java, XML, GPS integration, Voice Commands, Android APIs.

  
How to Run:
  
    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    
    Open the project in Android Studio.
    
    Run the app on a compatible Android device or emulator.

Note: This interface is designed for educational purposes, focusing on accessibility and usability for elderly users with memory impairments.
